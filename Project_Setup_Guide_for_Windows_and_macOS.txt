Project Setup Guide
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the project on both Windows and macOS.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)
npm (comes with Node.js)
MySQL (or your preferred database system)
Git (optional, for version control)

Setup Steps
1. Clone the Repository
If using Git:
 git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [your-project-name]
If not using Git, download the project zip file and extract it to your preferred location.
2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:
cd [backend-directory-name]

Install dependencies:
 npm install

Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the backend root directory
Add the following variables (adjust as needed):
CopyPORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASS=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key



Set up the database:

Create a new MySQL database
Run the SQL scripts provided in the project to create necessary tables


Start the backend server:
npm start


3. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
cd [frontend-directory-name]

Install dependencies:
npm install

Set up environment variables (if needed):

Create a .env file in the frontend root directory
Add any necessary frontend environment variables, e.g.:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api



Start the frontend development server:
npm start


Running the Project

Ensure the backend server is running (you should see a message like "Server running on port 3000")
Ensure the frontend development server is running (typically on http://localhost:3000)
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified by your React app)


Troubleshooting
Windows-specific Issues

If you encounter EACCES errors, try running the command prompt or PowerShell as administrator.
Ensure that MySQL service is running. You can start it from the Services application.

macOS-specific Issues

If you encounter permission issues, ensure that you have the necessary rights to access the project directories.
For MySQL issues, you might need to start the MySQL server using:
Copysudo mysqld_safe


General Issues

"Module not found" errors: Ensure all dependencies are installed by running npm install in both backend and frontend directories.
Database connection issues: Check your .env file and ensure all database credentials are correct.
JWT errors: Make sure your JWT_SECRET is set correctly in the backend .env file.

Additional Notes

Always ensure your backend server is running before starting the frontend.
For production deployment, additional steps like setting up a production database, configuring a web server (e.g., Nginx), and setting up SSL might be necessary.
Regularly update your dependencies to ensure you have the latest security patches.

If you encounter any issues not covered in this guide, please refer to the project's documentation or seek assistance from the project maintainers.
