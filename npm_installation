## Additional Notes

- For both Windows and macOS, npm is included with Node.js installation.
- These commands assume you're using the latest versions. If you need a specific version, you may need to modify the commands or download a specific installer.
- For MySQL on macOS, you can also download the DMG archive from the official MySQL website if you prefer not to use Homebrew.
